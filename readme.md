# Voidwave –

This is a short guide so we can work together in Unity without breaking the project or causing merge conflicts.

Repository: https://github.com/dorvuk/voidwave

---

## 1. Cloning the project
1. Install Git and Unity Hub.
2. Open a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/dorvuk/voidwave.git
3. In Unity Hub, click "Add" and select the cloned folder.
4. Install the Unity version shown in ProjectVersion.txt if needed.
5. Open the project. Unity will rebuild the Library folder automatically.

---

## 2. Daily workflow (IMPORTANT)
Always do these steps to avoid conflicts.

Before you start working:
git pull

After you finish working:
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you did"
git push

---

## 3. Branching
Before you do any work, create your own branch:
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

Push it the first time with:
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

Later, just:
git push

---

## 4. What NOT to edit at the same time
To avoid Unity merge conflicts, do not work on the same:
- Scene files (.unity)
- Prefabs used by multiple people
- Animator controllers
- Materials
- Large text assets (dialogue databases, etc.)

If you need to edit the same scene:
- Tell the group first
- Or split your work into prefabs inside the scene

---

## 5. What NOT to commit
These folders must stay out of git:
Library/
Temp/
Obj/
Build/
Builds/
Logs/
UserSettings/

These are automatically regenerated by Unity.

---

## 6. Recommended file types
Textures:
- Use: .png, .jpg
- Avoid committing large .psd files unless necessary

Audio:
- Use: .wav for SFX and music
- .ogg is also fine

Scripts:
- Always .cs

Models:
- Use: .fbx
- Avoid: .blend (requires Blender installed)

Docs:
- Use: .md or .txt

---

## 7. Multi-platform notes (Windows + macOS)
- Everyone must use the SAME Unity version (2022.3.26f1).
- Do not create two files that differ only by capital letters (example: Player.png / player.png).
- Avoid OS-specific paths in scripts.

---

## 8. Summary
- Pull before working.
- Commit and push after working.
- Do not work on the same scene/prefab simultaneously.
- Use the recommended file types.
- Keep ignored folders out of git.
